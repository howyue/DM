/* Capital gain and years in education has weak correlation

1.1.a
Done - Table

1.1.b
Done - Table & Histogram

1.1.c
Done - Apply Box & Whisker to find outlier
Done - Apply Pearson's Coefficient and Correlation (PROC CORR) to find correlation
Done - Apply K-means to find group with similar characteristic (Outlier need to be done first before k-means)
Done - Apply IQV on categorical attributes to find out the dispersion
X - Apply Apriori (PROC ASSOC) to find association

Bayesian Classification, Hypergraph-Based Clustering, and Fuzzy k-Modes Clustering

1.2.a
- Apply binning method to :
a) Years_in_Education (Bucket) - To see the skewness
b) Work_per_week (Bucket) - To see the skewness
   Work_per_week (Winsorized) - To smoothen the edge (Upper and Bottom) as there are a lot of outlier 
   - Refer to 1.1.b & 1.1.c  
  
1.2.b
- Update ? value to Unknown
- Apply Rank Transformation to Qualification & Salary
- Check if there's duplicates

- Apply Box Cox to Capital Gain & Loss to make smoothen the dispersion
- Update JobType to Govern Servant, Private or Self-employed

1.2.c

Summary
--------------
Female study more;
Female earn more;
assign a unique key to each observation
Qualification has any impact on income; higher earn more; 
Age has anyimpact on impact; older earn more;
What age range likes what occupation;
Asian work longer hours; Married work lesser hours;
Asian/Black/etc earn less but work more compare to white? or equal.
Government servant has higher education
Private sector earn more
Majority of the population has high education, at least high school. It's a left skewed distirbution
the sample dataset has a normal distribution of age?
interesting finding on the distribution of work per week, see1.2.a !
